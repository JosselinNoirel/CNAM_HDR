Dear *Name*,
 
I’m reaching out to you because, as an associate professor at CNAM in Paris *INSERT HERE BACKGROUND INFORMATION*, I entertain the hope of getting an “habilitation à diriger les recherches” (HDR).
 
The HDR is a postdoctoral degree that technically allows the recipient to supervise doctoral students and conduct research independently and it’s also a requirement before one can apply for full professorship.
 
My recent professional trajectory is *INSERT HERE SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND WHY IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE THEM AS REVIEWERS*
 
To give you an idea of the timeline, the application should be submitted in early May 2023 for a viva some time towards the end of 2023.  The viva would most likely happen remotely.  While this has obvious downsides in terms of sociability, it does give a little more flexibility that you may find useful before making your decision.  Like many researchers, you are undoubtedly very, very busy. I hope that you can take the time to consider my request, and I would be honoured if you could accept it.
 
I remain at your disposal to try and work out a solution that is optimal for you or simply to discuss the matter any way you like before you reach a decision.
 
I have attached a detailed CV to this email,
 
Best regards,
 
Josselin Noirel
