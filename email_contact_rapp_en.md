Dear Sarah,
 
I’m reaching out to you because, as an associate professor at CNAM in Paris, in Jean-François Zagury’s laboratory, I entertain the hope of getting an "habilitation à diriger les recherches” (HDR).
 
The HDR is a postdoctoral degree that technically allows the recipient to supervise doctoral students and conduct research independently and it’s also a requirement before one can apply for full professorship.
 
It's not meant to be a huge commitment for the members of the jury.
 
My recent professional trajectory is a bit difficult to pinpoint for a variety of personal and institutional reasons. Therefore, it is not necessarily easy to identify a unique scientific theme from my most recent work, but I can at least say what I aspire to, and it happens to fall somewhere between the themes of statistical genetics developed by someone like Hugues Aschard and Chloé Azencott's regarding data integration (through biological networks). I also have ties with the Institut Curie working on biomarkers for personalised medicine.
 
To give you an idea of the timeline, the application should be submitted in early May 2023 for a viva some time towards the end of 2023.  The viva would most likely happen remotely.  While this has obvious downsides in terms of sociability, it does give a little more flexibility that you may find useful before making your decision.  Like many researchers, you are undoubtedly very, very busy. I hope that you can take the time to consider my request, and I would be honoured if you could accept it.
 
I remain at your disposal to try and work out a solution that is optimal for you or simply to discuss the matter any way you like before you reach a decision.
 
I have attached a detailed CV to this email,
 
Best regards,
 
Josselin Noirel
